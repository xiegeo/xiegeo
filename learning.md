# The learning process

Start with nothing, curiosity drives learning.

This continues as we collect and use more information. We become better decision makers.

![Curve reaches up until it slows down and stops at an horizontal line labeled "Peak capacity"](/drawings/learning/peak.svg)

But, there is a limit to our brain compacity and processing power. Additional information becomes less valuable, and our ability to put everything in perspective is compromised.

The solution is compaction, or rule making.
